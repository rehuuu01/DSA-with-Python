# Week 07 – Dynamic Programming

## 📌 Overview

Dynamic Programming (DP) is an optimization technique used to solve problems by breaking them into smaller overlapping subproblems and storing their results to avoid recomputation.

This week focuses on building strong DP foundations and progressing toward advanced interview-level problems.

## 🎯 Goals of This Week

- Understand DP fundamentals
- Master 1D DP patterns
- Learn 2D Grid DP
- Solve subsequence problems
- Practice string-based DP
- Improve problem-solving intuition

DAY 41 - SUBSET SUM

This is the first major variation of 0/1 Knapsack.

Important Observations:
- Instead of maximizing value, we check existence.
- DP table stores boolean values.
- Base case: sum = 0 is always True.
- Reverse iteration required in 1D DP to prevent reuse of same element.

Very Important:
Subset Sum pattern is used in:
1. Equal Partition
2. Count of Subsets
3. Minimum Subset Sum Difference
4. Target Sum

This pattern is extremely common in interviews.

# Day 40 – 0/1 Knapsack Pattern Reinforcement

Today was focused on strengthening conceptual understanding of the 0/1 Knapsack pattern.

Key Learnings:
- State definition: dp[i][w]
- Take vs Skip decision
- Why reverse iteration is required in 1D DP
- Transition logic breakdown
- Mapping to related problems (Subset Sum, Equal Partition, Target Sum)

Goal: Deep understanding over repetition.

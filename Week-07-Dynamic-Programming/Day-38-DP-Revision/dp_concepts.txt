Dynamic Programming – Core Concepts
Day 38 Notes
==============================

1) What is Dynamic Programming?

Dynamic Programming (DP) is an optimization technique used
to solve problems by breaking them into smaller subproblems,
storing the results of those subproblems, and reusing them.

It is mainly used when:
- The problem has overlapping subproblems
- The problem has optimal substructure


----------------------------------

2) Overlapping Subproblems

When the same subproblem is solved multiple times.

Example:
In Fibonacci recursion,
fib(5) calls fib(4) and fib(3),
and fib(4) again calls fib(3) and fib(2).

This leads to repeated work.


----------------------------------

3) Optimal Substructure

A problem has optimal substructure if:
The optimal solution can be built from optimal solutions
of its subproblems.

Example:
Climbing Stairs:
Ways(n) = Ways(n-1) + Ways(n-2)

The best answer for n depends on best answers
of smaller values.


----------------------------------

4) Memoization vs Tabulation

Memoization:
- Top-Down approach
- Uses recursion
- Stores results in cache
- Easy to implement

Tabulation:
- Bottom-Up approach
- Iterative
- Builds solution from base cases
- More space efficient in many cases


----------------------------------

5) When to Think About DP?

If problem involves:
- Counting ways
- Minimum / Maximum
- Choices at each step
- Recursion with repeated calls

Then DP is likely applicable.


----------------------------------

6) General DP Steps

Step 1: Define state
Step 2: Write recurrence relation
Step 3: Identify base cases
Step 4: Decide memoization or tabulation
Step 5: Optimize space if possible


----------------------------------

Conclusion:

DP is not about memorizing problems.
It is about:
- Identifying state
- Understanding transitions
- Avoiding repeated computation

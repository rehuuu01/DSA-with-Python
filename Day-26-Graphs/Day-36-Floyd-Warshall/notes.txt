DAY 36 – Floyd Warshall Algorithm

Type:
All Pairs Shortest Path

Works For:
- Directed Graph
- Undirected Graph
- Negative weights allowed
- Not allowed: Negative cycle

Core Idea:
Try every node as intermediate

Formula:
dist[i][j] = min(dist[i][j], dist[i][k] + dist[k][j])

Time Complexity:
O(V^3)

Space Complexity:
O(V^2)

Negative Cycle Check:
If dist[i][i] < 0 → negative cycle exists

Comparison:
Dijkstra → single source, no negative weights
Bellman-Ford → single source, handles negative
Floyd-Warshall → all pairs, handles negative

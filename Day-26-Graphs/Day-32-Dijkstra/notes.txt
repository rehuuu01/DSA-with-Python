DAY 32 – DIJKSTRA NOTES
=============================

1️⃣ WHAT IS DIJKSTRA?

Dijkstra is a greedy algorithm that finds the shortest path
from a source node to all other nodes in a weighted graph
with NON-NEGATIVE edge weights.

---

2️⃣ MAIN IDEA

Always expand the node with the smallest distance first.

This is achieved using:
→ Min Heap (Priority Queue)

---

3️⃣ EDGE RELAXATION

If:

distance[u] + weight < distance[v]

Then update distance[v]

This process is called RELAXATION.

---

4️⃣ WHY SKIP OUTDATED ENTRIES?

When we push updated distances into the heap,
older larger values may still exist inside the heap.

So we check:

if curr_dist > dist[node]:
    continue

This avoids extra work.

---

5️⃣ BFS VS DIJKSTRA

BFS:
- Used for unweighted graphs
- Uses Queue
- Time: O(V + E)

Dijkstra:
- Used for weighted graphs
- Uses Min Heap
- Time: O((V + E) log V)

---

6️⃣ LIMITATION

Does NOT work for negative weights.

For negative weights:
→ Use Bellman-Ford Algorithm

---

7️⃣ INTERVIEW TIP

Common Questions:
- Why use heap?
- What happens if weights are negative?
- How to modify for directed graph?
- Can we stop early if target found?

---

8️⃣ INTUITION CHECK

If all weights are 1:
Dijkstra behaves exactly like BFS.

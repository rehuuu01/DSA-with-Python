Day 34 – Prim’s Algorithm Notes

1. Purpose:
   - Find Minimum Spanning Tree (MST)
   - Works on connected, undirected, weighted graph

2. Core Idea:
   - Start from any node
   - Use min heap to always pick smallest edge
   - Expand tree one node at a time

3. Algorithm Steps:
   - Initialize min heap with (0, start_node)
   - Maintain visited set
   - While heap not empty:
       - Pop smallest weight edge
       - If node not visited:
            - Add weight to total
            - Mark visited
            - Push its neighbors into heap

4. Why It Works:
   - Greedy choice property
   - At every step we choose smallest valid edge
   - Guarantees global minimum for MST

5. Difference from Kruskal:
   - Prim grows tree from node
   - Kruskal sorts edges globally
   - Prim uses heap
   - Kruskal uses DSU

6. Difference from Dijkstra:
   - Prim minimizes total MST weight
   - Dijkstra minimizes distance from source

7. Time Complexity:
   O(E log V)

8. When to Use:
   - Dense graphs
   - When adjacency list representation is available

9. Important Interview Points:
   - Graph must be connected for full MST
   - If graph disconnected → get Minimum Spanning Forest
   - Can start from any node

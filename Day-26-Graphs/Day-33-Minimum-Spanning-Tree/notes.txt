DAY 33 – MINIMUM SPANNING TREE (MST)

1️⃣ What is a Spanning Tree?

- A spanning tree is a subgraph of a connected, undirected graph
- It connects all vertices
- Contains exactly (V - 1) edges
- Contains no cycles

------------------------------------------------------

2️⃣ What is Minimum Spanning Tree (MST)?

Among all possible spanning trees,
the one with minimum total edge weight is called MST.

------------------------------------------------------

3️⃣ Why MST?

- Network design (roads, cables, internet)
- Minimum cost connection problems
- Clustering algorithms
- Greedy algorithm applications

------------------------------------------------------

4️⃣ Kruskal’s Algorithm (Greedy)

Core Idea:
Always pick the smallest edge that does NOT form a cycle.

Steps:
1. Sort all edges by weight.
2. Initialize Disjoint Set (Union-Find).
3. Iterate over sorted edges:
    - If adding edge does not form cycle → add it.
4. Stop when (V - 1) edges are added.

------------------------------------------------------

5️⃣ Cycle Detection

To detect cycle efficiently:
Use Disjoint Set (Union-Find)

Operations:
- find(x) → returns parent (with path compression)
- union(x, y) → merge sets (union by rank)

------------------------------------------------------

6️⃣ Disjoint Set Optimizations

✔ Path Compression
    - Makes tree flat
    - Improves future find operations

✔ Union by Rank
    - Attach smaller tree under larger tree
    - Keeps tree height small

------------------------------------------------------

7️⃣ Time Complexity

Sorting edges → O(E log E)
Union-Find operations → ~O(E)

Final Time Complexity:
O(E log E)

------------------------------------------------------

8️⃣ Important Observations

- MST exists only if graph is connected.
- If graph has V vertices → MST has (V - 1) edges.
- MST is not always unique.
- Works only for Undirected Graphs.

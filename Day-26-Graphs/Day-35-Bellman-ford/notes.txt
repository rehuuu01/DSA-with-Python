DAY 35 - BELLMAN FORD ALGORITHM

Core Idea:
-----------
Repeatedly relax all edges to gradually find shortest paths.

Relaxation:
------------
If dist[u] + weight < dist[v]
    update dist[v]

Why (V - 1) times?
-------------------
A shortest path in a graph can have at most (V - 1) edges.
So after (V - 1) iterations, all shortest paths must be finalized.

Negative Weight Cycle:
-----------------------
If after (V - 1) iterations we can still relax an edge,
it means there exists a cycle whose total weight is negative.

That cycle allows infinite reduction in path cost,
so shortest path does not exist.

When to Use:
------------
- Graph contains negative weights
- Need to detect negative cycles
- Directed graphs
- Competitive programming problems

Difference from Dijkstra:
--------------------------
Dijkstra fails when negative weights are present
because it assumes once a node is finalized, it cannot improve.

Bellman-Ford does not make that assumption.

Optimization Insight:
----------------------
If during any iteration no distance updates occur,
we can stop early (early stopping optimization).

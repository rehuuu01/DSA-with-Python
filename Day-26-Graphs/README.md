# Week 06 – Graphs

This week focuses on mastering Graph data structures and algorithms.

Graphs are one of the most important topics in Data Structures and Algorithms,
frequently asked in product-based company interviews.

## ⏱ Overall Complexity Pattern

Most graph algorithms in this week follow:

Time Complexity: **O(V + E)**  
Space Complexity: **O(V)**  

Where:
- V = Number of vertices
- E = Number of edges

## 🚀 Progression

This week marks the transition from:
Basic traversal → Graph applications → Advanced graph algorithms

The foundation built here prepares for:
- Tarjan’s Algorithm
- Dijkstra’s Algorithm
- Union-Find (Disjoint Set)
- Advanced interview-level graph problems

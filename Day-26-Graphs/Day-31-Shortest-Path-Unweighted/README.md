# Day 31 – Shortest Path (Unweighted Graph)

## Problem
Find shortest distance from source to all nodes in an unweighted graph.

## Algorithm Used
Breadth First Search (BFS)

## Why BFS?
BFS explores level by level.
First visit = shortest distance in unweighted graph.

## Time Complexity
O(V + E)

## Space Complexity
O(V)

## Key Learning
- BFS guarantees shortest path in unweighted graph
- Foundation for Dijkstra’s algorithm

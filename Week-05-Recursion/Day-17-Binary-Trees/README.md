# Day 17: Binary Trees 🌳

## 📌 Topic
Binary Tree Traversals (Depth First Search)

---

## 🧠 Concepts Covered
- What is a Binary Tree
- TreeNode structure
- Depth First Traversals using Recursion
  - Preorder Traversal (Root → Left → Right)
  - Inorder Traversal (Left → Root → Right)
  - Postorder Traversal (Left → Right → Root)

---

## 🧩 Problems Implemented
1. Binary Tree Preorder Traversal
2. Binary Tree Inorder Traversal
3. Binary Tree Postorder Traversal

---

## 🛠 Approach
- Used recursion to traverse the binary tree.
- A helper recursive function is defined inside each traversal method.
- The binary tree is **manually constructed** in the `main` section for simplicity and clarity.
- Each node is visited exactly once.

---

## ⏱ Time & Space Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** `O(n)`  
  (Each node is visited once)
- **Space Complexity:** `O(n)`  
  (Recursion stack + result list)

## 📂 Files
- `preorder_traversal.py
- `inorder_traversal.py
- `postorder_traversal.py

---

## ✅ Key Learnings
- Understood how recursion works naturally with tree structures.
- Learned the difference between preorder, inorder, and postorder traversals.
- Strengthened DFS intuition for upcoming tree problems.

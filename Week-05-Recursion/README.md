## 📅 Day-wise Progress

### ✅ Day 15 – Recursion Basics
**Problems Covered:**
- Print 1 to N
- Print N to 1
- Factorial of a number
- Sum of first N natural numbers
- Reverse an array using recursion (two pointers)

**Key Learnings:**
- Importance of a clear base case
- Recursive calls must reduce problem size
- Order of execution (before vs after recursion)
- Recursion can replace loops for cleaner logic

### ✅ Day 16 – Backtracking Basics
**Problems Covered:**
- Subsets (Power Set)
- Permutations
- Combination Sum

**Key Learnings:**
- Backtracking = recursion + undo
- Decision tree exploration
- State management using `append()` and `pop()`
- Used index control and visited arrays to avoid duplicates

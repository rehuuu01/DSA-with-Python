# Day 15 – Recursion Basics

## 📌 Topics Covered
- Introduction to Recursion
- Base Case and Recursive Case
- Understanding Recursive Call Stack
- Using recursion with classic patterns

---

## ✅ Problems Solved

1. **Print Numbers from 1 to N**
   - Recursive call first, then print
   - Demonstrates stack unwinding

2. **Print Numbers from N to 1**
   - Print before recursive call
   - Demonstrates top-down recursion

3. **Factorial of a Number**
   - Classic recursion problem
   - Base case: n = 0 or 1

4. **Sum of First N Natural Numbers**
   - Recursive reduction of problem size
   - Avoided shadowing Python built-in functions

5. **Reverse an Array (Two Pointers + Recursion)**
   - Used start and end pointers
   - Recursion replaces iterative loop
   - In-place reversal

---

## 🧠 Key Learnings
- Always define a clear **base case**
- Recursive calls must move toward the base case
- Order of operations (before/after recursion) affects output
- Variables that change per call must be passed as parameters
- Recursion often trades space for cleaner logic

---

## ⏱️ Complexity Notes
- Most problems: **O(n) time**
- Recursion stack: **O(n) space**
